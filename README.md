# Mohrs_2D
Given current planar stress state, constructs the corresponding Mohr's circle, labeling principle normal stresses, maximum shear stress, and initial stress coordinates.
Updated to make use of Cauchy stress tensor in calculations.
General 3D case now up in seperate repository: https://github.com/adammq/Mohrs_Circles
